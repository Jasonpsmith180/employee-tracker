# Employee Tracker

## Description
A good database is properly formatted to make data easy to read and find. But not everyone is a master of database commands so a good interface to make things easier for the less experienced database user can be very important. The employee tracker app is a command line interface that allows the user to view all of the departments, roles, and employees in their company as well as add departments, roles, and employees. Employees can even have their roles updated and their department, title and salary will all change with the update. See the video demonstration below!
